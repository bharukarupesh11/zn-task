#Steps to run the backend project:
You can use the below commands to run the REST API code,
	nodemon app.js    OR      node app.js
	
	Note: You need to do following things in order to run the backend code successfully,
		1.	Create a schema in mysql with “products_listing_app” name.
		2.	Give your database username as “root” and password as “admin” because the same is mentioned in the index.js file in the model directory.
		3.	You must create “uploads” and “products” folder in the project directory where our backend code resides.
